# Expectations 

What I expect from some system managing storage of streams of events, intended to be used in an event-sourced system.

- ability to create streams
- ability to delete streams
- ability to use optimistic locking on stream level
- ability to write a batch of events in one stream atomically and durably
- ability to read events from one stream 
- ability to read all events in the store ( the so called "$all" stream)
- ability to read forward and backward
- ability to read from some position in a stream or from the "$all" stream
- ability to remove events before some position in a stream
- ability to remove events before some time
- ability to have subscription (though I might consider it a bonus)
- ability to read events from a stream in commit order 
- ability to read events from "$all" stream in commit order
- ability to have metadata on stream level   
- ability to have metadata on stream level even if the stream does not exists yet
- ability to have metadata on events
- idempotent writes (more on that later)
- support for high-availability scenarios
- support for at least write quorums and causally consistent, monotonic reads

other functionalities are bonuses, some bonuses are evil

Examples of bonuses
- ACL on streams
- server side managed subscriptions 
- system streams 
  - deleted streams

Examples of evil bonuses  
- Transactional write on multiple streams:
  - you can avoid it by carefully designing your streams
  
- allowing to participate in Distributed Transactions
  - e.g. writing to a stream and updating a read model in another storage atomically
