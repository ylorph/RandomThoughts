# My versus Ours

My idea versus Our ideas.  
My goal versus Our goals.  
My problem versus Our problems.  
My work versus Our work.

We need to strike a balance between "My" and "Ours", given the current people needs.

What I noticed, in _my_ experience, is that solving "Ours" solves "My" as well. Most of the Time.  
While solving "My" _rarely_ solves "Ours".
